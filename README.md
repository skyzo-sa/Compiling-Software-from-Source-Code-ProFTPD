# BASH Scripting Lab â€“ Compiling Software from Source Code: ProFTPD

## Objective

The main objective of the Linux Lab is to learn how to manually compile and install software from its source code on a Linux system, using ProFTPD (a popular and flexible FTP server) as the example.

### Job Skills Learned

- Understanding the Source Compilation Process
- Installing Required Dependencies
- Customizing Software Installations
- Troubleshooting Common Issues
- Managing Installed Software


### Tools Used

- Linux Terminal Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Package Manager: apt, yum or dnf
- Build Tools: GCC, Make
- Networking Tools: wget, netstat, ss and lsof, ping, ifconfig
- File Management Tools: tar, vim
- VMware Tools: Linux VM
- ProFTPD (a popular and flexible FTP server)



### STEPS
